# THIS CHEAT NO LONGER WORKS (kinda)
**This is really easy to get working again** add your own driver & add the new offsets of UC (I will not help u tho)

# What is this and why?
My private Apex Legends SRC code. I worked on this with NXTG3N before he got cut due to Activision's lawyers. Iâ€™ve decided to release this for educational purposes, as I no longer use this SRC, and a lot of the code is poor.
This SRC can easily be updated to newer Apex versionsâ€”just add your own driver and update the offsets. Note that this was my first external cheat; before this, I only made internals.

## Improvements

Ok, first off, ESP, skeleton, etc., was kinda an afterthought. This is evident in the render loop where I call the ESP function to render. Now, this is fine, but we are reading the player and bone array in the overlay function, which will cause massive overlay FPS drops.

[Esp being called in the overlay loop ðŸ˜‘](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/apex-matic/blob/main/usermode/overlay/overlay.cpp#L185)

[Then readin the enity list again ðŸ˜‘](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/apex-matic/blob/main/usermode/modules/features/esp.cppL24)

This is fine, I guess, for internal cheats where reads & writes are much faster, but itâ€™s a no-go for externals. For example, in my CS2 cheat, I read the entity list once in a thread and grab all the info needed (like health, etc.), then I put it in a struct:

``` c++
struct player {
    uintptr_t CSPlayerPawn;
    bool isLocalPlayer;

    std::string name;
    int health;
    float distance;
    bool isAlive;

    int teamID;

    bool sameteam;
    bool isVisable;


    vec3 position3d;
    vec2 position2d;

    std::map<std::string, vec3> BonePosition3d;
    std::map<std::string, vec2> BonePosition2d;
}
```

Then we can just do the drawing in the overlay in bulk, saving on massive performance.

## What Went Well

Not bad for my first externalâ€”could be better. It has many good features that work well.
